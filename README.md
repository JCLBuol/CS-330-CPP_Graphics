How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    Working on this project has helped me see how projects can be broken down into parts that can be reused for different parts of the overall project.  For instance, when multiple objects may need a cube or cylinder for their overall appearance so you can write the code to create these objects then 
    call them for the different objects then manipulate them to fit the needs of that object.  By doing this you can save yourself the need to write the code to create the cube multiple times.
    
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    For this project I started by finding the objects that I wished to recreate and then started with the easiest part to create which would be the plane.  From there I continued by creating each indavidual part that I needed and moving them on the plane to the location that I felt gave it the most accurate 
    appearance that I was hoping to achinve.  Once I had all of my objects created and placed I then got my camera movement dialed in, then I moved to getting my textures created and finally created my lighting.  Once I had all of these completed I looked at the overall look of the project and worked on polishing 
    the final appearence.
    
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    For creating any project I think the same basic steps can be applied.  By breaking it down into more bit sized parts that can be completed and tested on their own it lets you dial in smaller pieces of work that will be easier to troubleshoot if there is a problem as well as give you a much better 
    feel for progression.  

How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    This was my first time working with creating any sort of graphics using opengl so everything that I did was new to me.  The main strategy that I used while working on this project was to break the project down into smaller pieces and work on each indavidually.  Once I had the overall look that I wanted I then 
    worked on the effects that I wanted to implement such as textures, lighting and camera movement.
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    Since we worked on this project each week throughout the class I would save a revision of my work for each assignment that I had to turn in.  So for each week I would add in the nessesary pices that I had to complete for the assignment and save it, then for the next weeks assignment I would save a new copy
    of my work to preserve the state of the last weeks work and then work on the new pices.  This way if I somehow made a mistake that broke the work that I had done prior I could scrap that file and go back to the revision that I knew was working and start over.
    
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Since I have been working with programming machines in my current job for quite awhile now my approach has not changed much since I have found a way that works for me and generally stick with it.  The main change that I have made through working with this milestone is what resources I have been falling back on 
    when I run into a roadblock.  In the beginning I had a hard time finding fixes to the problems that I was running into but as the class has moved on I found a few resources that helped me when I was stuck and I learned a lot of new techniques that have helped me with completing this milestone.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Since I still am not sure which path I would like to follow for my future career I am not sure which path I will be taking over the next few years on my educational pathway.  However, I do know that all of the challenges that I faced during this class and all the processes that I have learned will help
    me no matter what path I take.  
    
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    The skills that I have both learned and honed during this class I will be able to carry with me through whatever professional pathway that I end up on.  Having the skills to be able to run into a complicated problem, break it down and find a solution to it applies to anything that can be done in the computer
    science world.
